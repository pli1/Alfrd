### Info
Quick code credited to Philip Whitfield  "https://github.com/underdoeg/".
I've only made a few modifications on the way the captured bits are processed.

There is an improved version of underdoeg's one here: "https://gist.github.com/iilxy/f8b95cd039759b18edcdfe60684a6b8f"

##### Notice

This project was ported from https://github.com/tatobari/hx711py to work with python3 and added functions for my needs
